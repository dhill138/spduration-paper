-[ ] Check package to paper documentation consistency
-[x] default value for spdur distribution? Document in paper and roxygen
-[x] Can Table 1 include more variables? at risk
-[x] Add method used to estimate parameter variance
-[ ] Short discussion of different cure rates and utility of split approach (simulations)

## Reviewer comments

> (1) check the consistence between the R documentation of the package and the paper. (e.g. the # of observations and variables on manual are not consistent with what it’s described in paper) 

Updated package documentation for `data(bscoup); ?bscoup` to mention correct number of rows and columns in data. 

> (2) for ‘spdur’ function, does user need to specify ‘distr’ or the default is Weibull? The first example ‘weib_model’ didn’t specify distribution but the manual doesn’t mention the default value. 

The "distr" argument defaults to "weibull"; we have updated the package documentation to mention that, but also fixed the paper examples to explicitly use the "distr" option without relying on default behavior. 

> (3) Can Table 1 include more variables? e.g. atrisk was included in the model but not listed in the table. I think listing those variables would help users better understand the data structure. 

We added several of the other variables added to the training data frame by `add_duration` to Table 1, and also updated the text to mention those and the other variables generated by the function. 

> (4) add the method that was used to estimate the parameter variance. 

We added this to the text:

"The estimates are based on maximum likelihood estimation and standard errors are derived using the Hessian matrix of the optimization results."

> (5) because the paper does not include any simulation results, would a short description of the performance of the split population model for different ‘cure’ rates enhance users’ confidence in using this package to re-analyze their data.
